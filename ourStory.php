											<h2>Our Story</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The Green River PC Repair shop opened January 6, 2011 by Spunky. The PC Repair shop is completely student ran but is under faculty supervision. The students that work in the shop use the time they are there for some hands on, real world experience while also still getting an education. Some of the students may also volunteer their time to the shop.</p>
